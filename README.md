# Open-Source-Developement-Portfolio

This repository showcases my learning journey and contributions related to Open Source Development, version control with Git & GitHub, and practical experience with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. The portfolio is built as part of an academic project and highlights hands-on engagement with tools and workflows used in real-world software development.
